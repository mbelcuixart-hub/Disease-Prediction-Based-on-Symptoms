# Disease Prediction Based on Symptoms

This project contains a Google Colab notebook that predicts diseases based on user-reported symptoms.

## Main Notebook
- `notebooks/Disease_Prediction_Based_on_Symptoms.ipynb`: contains all the data preprocessing, analysis, and the prediction model.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to build a simple model that can help predict possible diseases based on the symptoms provided by a user.

## How to Use
1. Open the notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Run the cells in order.
3. Input the symptoms to get the model's prediction.
